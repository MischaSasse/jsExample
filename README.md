# jsExample
This repo is used to teach my classmates the basics of JS

msNote: 
Classmates first need to understand the basics before just clicking and praying that it will work.


To run this application:
- clone the repo.
- `php -S localhost:8080` in terminal.
- open in browser.
- open inspect element -> console.
- - (firefox console is `ctrl+shift+i`)

## Happy Path
- 1  User follows the run instructions and sees `hello :D` in console.
- 2  User clicks on the button and the text color changes.

## Unhappy Path
- 1a User doesnt see `hello :D`.
- 2a User clicks on the button but the text doesn't change.
